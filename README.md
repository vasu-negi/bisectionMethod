bisectionMethod Version1.0 3/4/2015
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The bisection method in mathematics is a root-finding method that repeatedly bisects 
an interval and then selects a subinterval in which a root must lie for further processing.


HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1:The program would ask you to enter the  degree of the equation/polynomial.
For example: f(x)=2*x^3+x^2+10 , here degree is 3.

2:Now enter the coefficients of the equation/polynomial.
For example: f(x)=2*x^3+x^2+10 , here the coefficients would be 2 , 1 and 10.

3: Now you have to make the first guess.

The guesses should be like this:-

a: Assume you have selected two numbers(x1,x2) as guesses
b: then, this must be TRUE ->   (f(x1)<0 and f(x2)>0)
c:If you make wrong guess the program will abort.
